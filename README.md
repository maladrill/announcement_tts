Your Open Source Asterisk PBX GUI Solution
```
### What?
Announcement OpenAI TTS - it doesnt replace the TTS module.
Plays back one of the system recordings generated by openAI from your text and then goes to another destination.

### How to use it?
Obtain OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys - it is something like this: sk-proj-and4lotOfNum8ers8letters

Log into to your FreePBX shell and create file containing your key in /etc/asterisk/openai.key  
 
### For example:
In the Linux shell paste the below command (don't forget to add your openAI  key):

`touch /etc/asterisk/openai.key & echo "-<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>" > /etc/asterisk/openai.key`

Then go to: Admin -> Module Admin -> Upload and choose Download (From Web) and paste this link: https://github.com/maladrill/announcement_tts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip 

Then click Manage Local Modules and find Anouncements TTS and chose Install and then Process.

Add config page in Settings to hold OpenAI API key
